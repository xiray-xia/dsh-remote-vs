/**
 * The session change panel above the composer (the Cursor-style review list).
 *
 * Placement is the point: `conversation.input.dock` is the one full-width seat
 * the shell renders directly above the composer card — the todo, goal and queue
 * panels already live there — so the list is visible while the user types the
 * next instruction instead of being scrolled away in the conversation.
 *
 * Data comes from the plugin's own ledger (`/api/dsh-remote/changes`), not from
 * DSH's `workspaceChanges`: that recorder cannot see a routed session at all
 * (its git baseline is parsed with host path semantics and its scratch index is
 * written with `node:fs`), which the probe measured as 58 remote sessions with
 * zero change events.
 *
 * Clicking a row opens the file in the remote editor and hands the editor the
 * same hunks, so the changed lines are painted in place.

 * Props the composer dock hands us.

 * Typed narrowly on purpose: the slot's full owner/standard prop surface comes
 * from `dsh-client-ui-conversation`, and depending on that package for types
 * drags a second DSH chain into this repo (same reason `conversation.view` is
 * soft-typed in index.tsx). Everything else is read from the plugin's own store.
